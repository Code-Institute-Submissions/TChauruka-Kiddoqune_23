        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are black, purple, green and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Lato and Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall-back font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
